# fault-localization

### In this project we proposed a coefficient-based fault localization technique by leveraging testing coverage information and code length as syntactical feature. 
We also compare our result with state-of-the-art: Dstar and Jaccard

 - To extract the feature, we use python.
 - To calculate exam score, we use MATLAB.

The experiment results can be found in the "proposed method & results.pdf"
